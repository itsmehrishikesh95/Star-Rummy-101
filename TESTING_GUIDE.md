# Testing Guide - Game Rules Fixes

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### Fix 1: Declare Button Now Enables ✅
**Problem:** Button never enabled, even with valid hand  
**Solution:** Changed validation to check hand AFTER discard  
**File:** `src/screens/GameScreen.jsx` (Line 1155)

### Fix 2: Drop Popup Now Closes ✅
**Problem:** Popup appeared but never closed, blocking next round  
**Solution:** Added modal state reset in `startNextRound()`  
**File:** `src/screens/GameScreen.jsx` (Line 1118)

### Fix 3: Dealer Rotation ✅
**Problem:** Random dealer each round (not standard rules)  
**Solution:** Changed to round-robin rotation  
**File:** `src/screens/GameScreen.jsx` (Line 1147)

## 🐛 Known Issues (Not Fixed)

These are NOT part of the current fixes but are noted for future:

1. **Card Grouping Display** - Cards are grouped by suit, not by valid melds
   - This is cosmetic only
   - Validation uses correct engine
   - Not blocking gameplay

2. **AI Strategy** - AI discards highest point invalid card
   - Simple but functional
   - Not blocking gameplay

3. **Multiplayer** - Currently mock/local only
   - Photon integration needed
   - Not in scope for this fix

## 📊 Console Debugging

### Useful Console Messages:

**Declare Validation:**
```
🎯 DECLARE CHECK { valid: true, reason: undefined, handSize: 13, selectedCard: '4♠' }
```

**Turn Engine:**
```
TURN ENGINE: TURN START { currentTurn: 0, gameState: 'draw', hasDrawn: false }
```

**Score Updates:**
```
DEBUG: score calculation { playerDelta: 20, aiDeltas: [0,0,0,0,0], reason: 'Drop penalty applied (+20)' }
```

**Elimination:**
```
DEBUG: elimination trigger - player reached 101+ { player: 'You', score: 101 }
```

## 🎓 Understanding the Fixes

### Why Declare Button Was Broken:

**Old Logic:**
```javascript
const canDeclareMove = !!validateMove('declare').ok
```

This checked if you COULD declare, but `validateMove` was checking the CURRENT hand, not the hand AFTER discarding.

**New Logic:**
```javascript
const canDeclareMove = useMemo(() => {
  // ... check requirements ...
  const handAfterDiscard = playerHand.filter(c => c.id !== selectedCard.id)
  const verdict = getDeclarationVerdict(handAfterDiscard)
  return verdict.valid
}, [isPlayerTurn, gameState, hasDrawn, selectedCard, playerHand])
```

This checks if the hand AFTER discarding the selected card would be valid.

### Why Drop Popup Was Stuck:

**Old Logic:**
```javascript
function startNextRound() {
  // ... deal new round ...
  // ❌ Never closed the modal!
}
```

**New Logic:**
```javascript
function startNextRound() {
  setShowResult(false)  // ✅ Close modal
  setShowDeclare(false) // ✅ Close declare modal
  setResultMsg('')      // ✅ Clear message
  // ... deal new round ...
}
```
