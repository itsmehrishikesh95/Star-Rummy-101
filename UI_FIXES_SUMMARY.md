# UI Bug Fixes - Quick Summary

## ✅ ALL 3 BUGS FIXED

---

## 🎯 Bug 1: Deck Not Clickable

**Problem:** Open/Closed deck cards wouldn't respond to clicks/taps

**Fix:**
- Added `pointerEvents: 'none'` to decorative layers (glow, stacked cards)
- Added `pointerEvents: 'auto'` to clickable motion.div wrappers
- Only actual card elements receive pointer events

**Result:** ✅ Decks now clickable when drawable

---

## 🎯 Bug 2: Glow Too Large

**Problem:** Glow effect extended 16px beyond card bounds (oversized halo)

**Fix:**
- Reduced `inset: -8` → `inset: -3` (8px → 3px extension)
- Reduced `blur(8px)` → `blur(5px)` (smaller blur radius)
- Reduced opacity `0.4` → `0.35` (more subtle)

**Result:** ✅ Glow constrained to card bounds, premium subtle effect

---

## 🎯 Bug 3: Cards Clipped

**Problem:** Selected/lifted cards cut off at top when hovering

**Fix:**
- Added `paddingTop: 24` to PlayerHand container (space for lift)
- Increased hover lift `-16px` → `-20px` (more dramatic)
- Added explicit `overflow: 'visible'` on containers
- Added `position: 'relative'` for stacking context

**Result:** ✅ Cards lift fully visible, no clipping
