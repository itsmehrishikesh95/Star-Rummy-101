# UI Interaction & Rendering Fixes Applied

## PART 1: DECK CLICKABILITY FIX ✅

### Issue
Open/Closed deck cards were not clickable despite having onClick handlers.

### Root Cause
1. Glow effect layers extended beyond card bounds (`inset: -8`) creating large hit areas
2. Decorative card layers (stacked CardBack components) didn't have `pointerEvents: none`
3. Framer Motion wrapper divs didn't have explicit `pointerEvents` control

### Fix Applied

**File: `src/screens/CenterArea.jsx`**

**Closed Deck (lines ~215-270):**
- Added `pointerEvents: 'none'` to glow effect layer
- Added `pointerEvents: 'none'` to decorative stacked CardBack layers (top 2 cards)
- Added `pointerEvents: canDrawClosed ? 'auto' : 'none'` to motion.div wrapper
- Only the actual clickable CardBack has pointer events enabled

**Open Deck (lines ~345-395):**
- Added `pointerEvents: 'none'` to glow effect layer
- Added `pointerEvents: canDrawOpen ? 'auto' : 'none'` to motion.div wrapper
- Only the actual clickable CardFace has pointer events enabled

### Result
✅ Closed deck clickable when `canDrawClosed === true`
✅ Open deck clickable when `canDrawOpen === true`
✅ Glow effects no longer intercept clicks
✅ Mobile touch support preserved

## PART 2: GLOW SIZE FIX ✅

### Issue
Glow/pulse effect was larger than actual card dimensions, creating oversized halos.

### Root Cause
- Glow used `inset: -8` (extends 8px beyond card on all sides)
- Blur radius was `blur(8px)` (large blur spread)
- Total glow extended ~16px beyond card bounds

### Fix Applied

**File: `src/screens/CenterArea.jsx`**

**Both Closed & Open Deck Glows:**
- Changed `inset: -8` → `inset: -3` (reduced from 8px to 3px extension)
- Changed `blur(8px)` → `blur(5px)` (reduced blur radius)
- Changed `borderRadius: 16` → `borderRadius: 14` (matches card radius better)
- Reduced opacity: `rgba(245,197,24,0.4)` → `rgba(245,197,24,0.35)`
- Reduced boxShadow glow: `0 0 24px` → `0 0 20px`

### Result
✅ Glow constrained to exact card bounds (±3px)
✅ Premium subtle glow effect maintained
✅ No oversized halo
✅ Glow follows card border radius

---

## PART 3: CARD CLIPPING FIX ✅

### Issue
Selected/lifted cards were clipped vertically when hovering or selecting.

### Root Cause
1. Cards lift with `y: -16` on hover and `y: -12` when selected
2. Parent containers might not have enough padding/space above
3. No explicit overflow handling on card container

### Fix Applied

**File: `src/screens/PlayerHand.jsx`**

**1. Increased Lift Distance (lines ~180-195):**
- Changed hover lift: `y: -16` → `y: -20` (more dramatic lift)
- Changed hover scale: `1.08` → `1.1` (slightly larger)
- Changed selected lift: `y: -12` → `y: -14` (in motion.div animate)
- Changed dragging lift: `y: -8` → `y: -10`

**2. Added Top Padding (lines ~420-428):**
- Added `paddingTop: 24` to main PlayerHand container
- Added `overflow: 'visible'` explicitly
- This creates space above cards for lift animations

**3. Added Position Context (lines ~450-460):**
- Added `position: 'relative'` to hand content wrapper
- Ensures proper stacking context for lifted cards

**4. Reduced Glow Intensity (lines ~185, ~210):**
- Reduced drop-shadow intensity on selected cards
- Changed `rgba(245,197,24,0.4)` → `rgba(245,197,24,0.35)`
- Changed `0 16px 24px` → `0 14px 22px`
- Changed `0 16px 32px` → `0 14px 28px`

### Result
✅ Selected cards fully visible (no vertical clipping)
✅ Hover lift never clipped
✅ Hand layout remains stable
✅ No layout jumping
✅ Proper z-index ordering maintained

## PART 4: VISUAL POLISH ✅

### Improvements Applied

**Glow Intensity:**
- Reduced from `0.4` to `0.35` opacity
- Reduced blur from `8px` to `5px`
- Reduced boxShadow from `24px` to `20px`
- More subtle, premium feel

**Card Shadows:**
- Selected card shadow reduced for balance
- Hover shadow maintained for feedback
- Drop shadows optimized for performance

**Lift Animations:**
- Increased hover lift to `-20px` for better feedback
- Increased scale to `1.1` for emphasis
- Smooth transitions preserved

---

## FILES MODIFIED

1. **src/screens/CenterArea.jsx**
   - Fixed deck clickability (pointer events)
   - Fixed glow size (inset, blur, opacity)
   - Lines changed: ~30 lines across 2 deck sections

2. **src/screens/PlayerHand.jsx**
   - Fixed card clipping (padding, overflow, lift distance)
   - Reduced glow intensity for polish
   - Lines changed: ~15 lines across 4 sections
