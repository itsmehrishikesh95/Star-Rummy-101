# Multiplayer Stability Fixes Applied - 101 Pool Rummy

## Date: May 6, 2026

## Summary
Applied 2 medium-priority fixes identified in the multiplayer stability audit to prevent action spam and stale async callbacks.

---

## ✅ FIX 1: Discard Spam Protection (MEDIUM Priority)

### Problem
The discard action had no execution lock, allowing users to rapidly click the "Discard" button multiple times during the animation, potentially queuing multiple discards and breaking hand size validation.

### Root Cause
- Draw action had `drawPendingRef` lock ✅
- Discard action only had validation, no lock ❌
- Animation callbacks executed without checking if action was already in progress

### Exploit Scenario
1. User draws a card
2. User selects card to discard
3. User rapidly clicks "Discard" button 3 times
4. First click triggers animation + setTimeout
5. Second click passes validation (still in 'discard' state)
6. Third click passes validation
7. Result: Multiple discards queued, hand size becomes invalid

### Changes Made

#### 1. Added `discardPendingRef` (Line ~505)
**File:** `src/screens/GameScreen.jsx`

**Added:**
```javascript
const discardPendingRef = useRef(false)
```

#### 2. Updated `discardCard()` function (Line ~1291)
**File:** `src/screens/GameScreen.jsx`

**Before:**
```javascript
function discardCard() {
  if (!runGuarded('discard', () => { })) return
  
  turnEngine.log('DISCARD', { selectedCard: selectedCard?.id, playerHandLength: playerHand.length, isPlayerTurn })
  
  setFlyingCard({ card: selectedCard, fromHand: true, toPile: 'discard' })
  
  setTimeout(() => {
    const newHand = playerHand.filter(c => c.id !== selectedCard.id)
    if (newHand.length !== 13) {
      showToast('You must have 13 cards after discarding')
      setFlyingCard(null)
      return
    }
    setDiscardPile(p => [...p, selectedCard])
    setPlayerHand(newHand)
    // ...
  }, 300)
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
function discardCard() {
  // FIX: Check discard lock to prevent spam
  if (discardPendingRef.current) {
    showToast('Discard already in progress...')
    return
  }
  
  if (!runGuarded('discard', () => { })) return

  // FIX: Set discard lock
  discardPendingRef.current = true

  turnEngine.log('DISCARD', { selectedCard: selectedCard?.id, playerHandLength: playerHand.length, isPlayerTurn })
  
  setFlyingCard({ card: selectedCard, fromHand: true, toPile: 'discard' })
  
  setTimeout(() => {
    // FIX: Validate round is still active (see Fix 2)
    if (activeRoundRef.current !== roundNumber) {
      console.log('DISCARD CALLBACK CANCELLED - Round changed')
      discardPendingRef.current = false
      setFlyingCard(null)
      return
    }
    
    const newHand = playerHand.filter(c => c.id !== selectedCard.id)
    if (newHand.length !== 13) {
      showToast('You must have 13 cards after discarding')
      setFlyingCard(null)
      discardPendingRef.current = false  // FIX: Release lock
      return
    }
    setDiscardPile(p => [...p, selectedCard])
    setPlayerHand(newHand)
    setFlyingCard(null)
    setSelectedCard(null)
    setHasDrawn(false)
    showToast(`Discarded ${selectedCard.rank}${selectedCard.suit}`)
    setGameState('draw')
    discardPendingRef.current = false  // FIX: Release lock
    turnEngine.advanceTurnOnce('player-discard')
  }, 300)
}
```

#### 3. Updated `startNextRound()` (Line ~1151)
**File:** `src/screens/GameScreen.jsx`

**Added:**
```javascript
discardPendingRef.current = false  // FIX: Clear discard lock
```

### Impact
- ✅ Prevents rapid discard button clicks
- ✅ Ensures only one discard action executes at a time
- ✅ Lock released after animation completes
- ✅ Lock cleared on round transition
- ✅ Consistent with draw action protection

---

## ✅ FIX 2: Stale Async Callback Protection (MEDIUM Priority)

### Problem
`setTimeout` callbacks in draw, discard, and auto-discard functions didn't validate if the round was still active, allowing state updates to apply to the wrong round after round transitions.

### Root Cause
- Callbacks used closure variables (stale state)
- No validation that round number was still the same
- Round transitions could happen during animation delays

### Exploit Scenario
1. Player draws a card (300ms animation starts)
2. Player immediately drops the game
3. Drop triggers `startNextRound()`
4. New round starts, hands are reset
5. 300ms later, draw callback fires
6. Callback adds old card to new hand
7. Result: Hand has 14 cards

### Changes Made

#### 1. Added `activeRoundRef` (Line ~506)
**File:** `src/screens/GameScreen.jsx`

**Added:**
```javascript
const activeRoundRef = useRef(1)
```

#### 2. Updated `drawFromPile()` callback (Line ~1273)
**File:** `src/screens/GameScreen.jsx`

**Before:**
```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  const newHand = [...playerHand, card]
  setPlayerHand(newHand)
  setFlyingCard(null)
  // ...
  setSelectedCard(card)
  setHasDrawn(true)
  setGameState('discard')
  drawPendingRef.current = false
}, 300)
```

**After:**
```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  // FIX: Validate round is still active
  if (activeRoundRef.current !== roundNumber) {
    console.log('DRAW CALLBACK CANCELLED - Round changed')
    drawPendingRef.current = false
    setFlyingCard(null)
    return
  }
  
  const newHand = [...playerHand, card]
  setPlayerHand(newHand)
  setFlyingCard(null)
  // ...
  setSelectedCard(card)
  setHasDrawn(true)
  setGameState('discard')
  drawPendingRef.current = false
}, 300)
```

#### 3. Updated `discardCard()` callback (Line ~1301)
**File:** `src/screens/GameScreen.jsx`

**Added:**
```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  // FIX: Validate round is still active
  if (activeRoundRef.current !== roundNumber) {
    console.log('DISCARD CALLBACK CANCELLED - Round changed')
    discardPendingRef.current = false
    setFlyingCard(null)
    return
  }
  
  const newHand = playerHand.filter(c => c.id !== selectedCard.id)
  // ... rest of logic ...
}, 300)
```

#### 4. Updated `autoDiscard()` callback (Line ~1483)
**File:** `src/screens/GameScreen.jsx`

**Before:**
```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  const newHand = playerHand.filter(c => c.id !== card.id)
  setDiscardPile(p => [...p, card])
  setPlayerHand(newHand)
  setSelectedCard(null)
  setHasDrawn(false)
  setGameState('draw')
  turnEngine.advanceTurnOnce('auto-discard-timeout')
}, 500)
```

**After:**
```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  // FIX: Validate round is still active
  if (activeRoundRef.current !== roundNumber) {
    console.log('AUTO-DISCARD CALLBACK CANCELLED - Round changed')
    return
  }
  
  const newHand = playerHand.filter(c => c.id !== card.id)
  setDiscardPile(p => [...p, card])
  setPlayerHand(newHand)
  setSelectedCard(null)
  setHasDrawn(false)
  setGameState('draw')
  turnEngine.advanceTurnOnce('auto-discard-timeout')
}, 500)
```

#### 5. Updated `startNextRound()` (Line ~1178)
**File:** `src/screens/GameScreen.jsx`

**Added:**
```javascript
setRoundNumber(v => v + 1)
activeRoundRef.current = roundNumber + 1  // FIX: Update active round ref
```

### Impact
- ✅ Prevents stale callbacks from executing after round changes
- ✅ Callbacks validate round is still active before state updates
- ✅ Locks released even if callback is cancelled
- ✅ Prevents hand size corruption
- ✅ Prevents card duplication across rounds

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Case 1: Discard Spam Protection
1. Start a game
2. Draw a card
3. Select a card to discard
4. Rapidly click "Discard" button 10 times
5. **Expected:** Only one discard happens, toast shows "Discard already in progress..."
6. **Before Fix:** Multiple discards could queue
7. **After Fix:** ✅ Only one discard executes

### Test Case 2: Round Transition During Draw
1. Start a game
2. Click to draw a card (animation starts)
3. Immediately click "Drop" button
4. New round starts
5. Wait for draw animation to complete
6. **Expected:** Draw callback cancelled, hand has 13 cards
7. **Before Fix:** Old card added to new hand (14 cards)
8. **After Fix:** ✅ Callback cancelled, hand correct

### Test Case 3: Round Transition During Discard
1. Start a game
2. Draw a card
3. Select a card to discard
4. Click "Discard" (animation starts)
5. Immediately trigger round end (e.g., AI declares)
6. New round starts
7. Wait for discard animation to complete
8. **Expected:** Discard callback cancelled
9. **Before Fix:** Old card discarded from new hand
10. **After Fix:** ✅ Callback cancelled

### Test Case 4: Auto-Discard During Round Transition
1. Start a game
2. Draw a card
3. Let timer run to 0 (auto-discard triggers)
4. Immediately drop the game
5. New round starts
6. Wait for auto-discard animation to complete
7. **Expected:** Auto-discard callback cancelled
8. **Before Fix:** Old card discarded from new hand
